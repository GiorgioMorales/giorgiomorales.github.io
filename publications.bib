	abstract = {Response curves exhibit the magnitude of the response of a sensitive system to a varying stimulus. However, response of such systems may be sensitive to multiple stimuli (i.e., input features) that are not necessarily independent. As a consequence, the shape of response curves generated for a selected input feature (referred to as “active feature”) might depend on the values of the other input features (referred to as “passive features”). In this work we consider the case of systems whose response is approximated using regression neural networks. We propose to use counterfactual explanations (CFEs) for the identification of the features with the highest relevance on the shape of response curves generated by neural network black boxes. CFEs are generated by a genetic algorithm-based approach that solves a multi-objective optimization problem. In particular, given a response curve generated for an active feature, a CFE finds the minimum combination of passive features that need to be modified to alter the shape of the response curve. We tested our method on a synthetic dataset with 1-D inputs and two crop yield prediction datasets with 2-D inputs. The relevance ranking of features and feature combinations obtained on the synthetic dataset coincided with the analysis of the equation that was used to generate the problem. Results obtained on the yield prediction datasets revealed that the impact on fertilizer responsivity of passive features depends on the terrain characteristics of each field.},

	abstract = {In Precision Agriculture, the utilization of management zones (MZs) that take into account within-field variability facilitates effective fertilizer management. This approach enables the optimization of nitrogen (N) rates to maximize crop yield production and enhance agronomic use efficiency. However, existing works often neglect the consideration of responsivity to fertilizer as a factor influencing MZ determination. In response to this gap, we present a MZ clustering method based on fertilizer responsivity. We build upon the statement that the responsivity of a given site to the fertilizer rate is described by the shape of its corresponding N fertilizer-yield response (N-response) curve. Thus, we generate N-response curves for all sites within the field using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The shape of the approximated N-response curves is then characterized using functional principal component analysis. Subsequently, a counterfactual explanation (CFE) method is applied to discern the impact of various variables on MZ membership. The genetic algorithm-based CFE solves a multi-objective optimization problem and aims to identify the minimum combination of features needed to alter a site's cluster assignment. Results from two yield prediction datasets indicate that the features with the greatest influence on MZ membership are associated with terrain characteristics that either facilitate or impede fertilizer runoff, such as terrain slope or topographic aspect.},

In this work, we propose to further improve the yield prediction task by using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) given their unique ability to exploit the spatial information of small regions of the field. We present a novel CNN architecture called Hyper3DNetReg that takes in a multi-channel input raster and, unlike previous approaches, outputs a two-dimensional raster, where each output pixel represents the predicted yield value of the corresponding input pixel. Our proposed method then generates a yield prediction map by aggregating the overlapping yield prediction patches obtained throughout the field. Our data consist of a set of eight rasterized remotely-sensed features: nitrogen rate applied, precipitation, slope, elevation, topographic position index (TPI), aspect, and two radar backscatter coefficients acquired from the Sentinel-1 satellites. We use data collected during the early stage of the winter wheat growing season (March) to predict yield values during the harvest season (August). We present leave-one-out cross-validation experiments for rain-fed winter wheat over four fields and show that our proposed methodology produces better predictions than five compared methods, including Bayesian multiple linear regression, standard multiple linear regression, random forest, an ensemble of feedforward networks using AdaBoost, a stacked autoencoder, and two other CNN architectures.},

	abstract = {In recent years, Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) has become a powerful source for reliable data in applications such as remote sensing, agriculture, and biomedicine. However, hyperspectral images are highly data-dense and often benefit from methods to reduce the number of spectral bands while retaining the most useful information for a specific application. We propose a novel band selection method to select a reduced set of wavelengths, obtained from an HSI system in the context of image classification. Our approach consists of two main steps: the first utilizes a filter-based approach to find relevant spectral bands based on a collinearity analysis between a band and its neighbors. This analysis helps to remove redundant bands and dramatically reduces the search space. The second step applies a wrapper-based approach to select bands from the reduced set based on their information entropy values, and trains a compact Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to evaluate the performance of the current selection. We present classification results obtained from our method and compare them to other feature selection methods on two hyperspectral image datasets. Additionally, we use the original hyperspectral data cube to simulate the process of using actual filters in a multispectral imager. We show that our method produces more suitable results for a multispectral sensor design.},

	title = {Generation of {Site}-specific {Nitrogen} {Response} {Curves} for {Winter} {Wheat} using {Deep} {Learning}},
	abstract = {Nitrogen fertilizer response (N-response) curves are tools used to support farm management decisions. The conventional approach to model an N-response curve is to fit crop yield in response to a range of N fertilizer rates as a quadratic or exponential function. The purpose of the model is to identify the profit-maximizing N rate given the costs of nitrogen and the price paid for the crop yield. We show that N-response curves are not only field-specific but also site-specific and, as such, economic optimal (profit-maximizing) rates should be calculated for each field each year promoting the use of on-field precision experiments (OFPE) utilizing precision agriculture technologies. We propose a methodology that allows deriving N-response curves automatically instead of using parametric curve-fitting approaches. Thus, we obtain a specific non-parametric N-response curve for each 10 m x 10 m cell of a grid virtually draped on the field. First, we train a convolutional neural network called Hyper3DNetReg using remotely sensed data collected during the early stage of the winter wheat growing season (March) to predict crop harvest yield values. The neural network models the behavior of the field under different environmental and terrain conditions. Then, we use the trained prediction model to obtain an N-response curve per cell by simulating what would be the yield response given a range of nitrogen rate values between 0 and 150 pounds per acre (lbs/ac). Results show that the shape of the N-response curve depends on the region of the field from which it was calculated. Related work will address the problem of generating prescription maps that merge the site-specific economic optimal rates calculated from our N-response curves while also minimizing the overall fertilizer applied and the number of jumps between consecutive cells' nitrogen rates.},

	abstract = {Symbolic regression (SR) methods attempt to learn mathematical expressions that approximate the behavior of an observed system. However, when dealing with multivariate systems, they often fail to identify the functional form that explains the relationship between each variable and the system's response. To begin to address this, we propose an explainable neural SR method that generates univariate symbolic skeletons that aim to explain how each variable influences the system's response. By analyzing multiple sets of data generated artificially, where one input variable varies while others are fixed, relationships are modeled separately for each input variable. The response of such artificial data sets is estimated using a regression neural network (NN). Finally, the multiple sets of input-response pairs are processed by a pre-trained Multi-Set Transformer that solves a problem we termed Multi-Set Skeleton Prediction and outputs a univariate symbolic skeleton. Thus, such skeletons represent explanations of the function approximated by the regression NN. Experimental results demonstrate that this method learns skeleton expressions matching the underlying functions and outperforms two GP-based and two neural SR methods.},

However, the resulting hyperspectral images (HSIs) come at the cost of increased storage requirements, increased computational time to process, and highly redundant data. Thus, dimensionality reduction techniques are necessary to decrease the number of spectral bands while retaining the most useful information. Our contribution is two-fold: First, we propose a filter-based method called interband redundancy analysis (IBRA) based on a collinearity analysis between a band and its neighbors. This analysis helps to remove redundant bands and dramatically reduces the search space. Second, we apply a wrapper-based approach called greedy spectral selection (GSS) to the results of IBRA to select bands based on their information entropy values and train a compact convolutional neural network to evaluate the performance of the current selection. We also propose a feature extraction framework that consists of two main steps: first, it reduces the total number of bands using IBRA; then, it can use any feature extraction method to obtain the desired number of feature channels. We present classification results obtained from our methods and compare them to other dimensionality reduction methods on three hyperspectral image datasets.

Its architecture consists of two parts: a series of densely connected three-dimensional (3-D) convolutions used as a feature extractor, and a series of two-dimensional (2-D) separable convolutions used as a spatial encoder. We show that this design involves fewer trainable parameters compared to other approaches, yet without detriment to its performance.

	abstract = {Nowadays, it is frequent to monitor large crop areas using high-precision active sensors for measuring NDVI or multispectral cameras mounted on UAVs. However, the NDVI calculations using multispectral images differ from the readings of an active sensor for the same object or surface. What is more, there is a difference between the NDVI values of two multispectral images taken with different lighting conditions or height over the same object. In this paper, we propose new models to estimate NDVI using aerial images from a multispectral camera with values comparable to those of a portable active sensor. For this, we propose a methodology where three lambertian reflection surfaces are chosen and characterized with a hyperspectral camera. These surfaces appear in the aerial images and are used as control points of three NDVI values in the range of 0 to 1. Then, a linear model and an exponential model, derived from the original NDVI calculation expression, are proposed and evaluated, using the spectral information of the pixels inside a region equivalent to the active sensor reflection zone and the NDVI measurements of the same sensor. After the conditioning of the data, the parameters of the models are obtained by calculating the minimum squared errors. In addition, we have done a set of tests to verify the variations of the parameters versus the positioning uncertainty, different lighting conditions and different heights in the range of 15 to 40 m. The results show that the parameters of the two proposed models vary with the height, maintaining the absolute differences of NDVI close to 0.01, which is equivalent to the resolution of the active sensor; the smallest differences occur for the linear model in the interpolation interval, while the exponential model has a high accuracy near the upper limit of NDVI.},

	abstract = {Detecting shadows in high-resolution satellite images is a challenging task due to the fact that shadows can easily be mistaken for low reflectance soil or water and that such images have limited spectral bands. In this work, we propose a semantic level shadow segmentation by using generative adversarial networks and created a dataset of pre-processed images for training, validation and test. In this way, we trained a generator network that produces shadow masks with condition on a satellite image patch and tries to fool a discriminator, which is trained to discern if a given mask comes from the ground truth or from the generator model. The results achieve an accuracy of 95.85\% and a Kappa coefficient of 91.76\%, which is superior to the compared methods.},

	abstract = {Video surveillance through security cameras has become difficult due to the fact that many systems require manual human inspection for identifying violent or suspicious scenarios, which is practically inefficient. Therefore, the contribution of this paper is twofold: the presentation of a video dataset called UNI-Crime, and the proposal of a violent robbery detection method in CCTV videos using a deep-learning sequence model. Each of the 30 frames of our videos passes through a pre-trained VGG-16 feature extractor; then, all the sequence of features is processed by two convolutional long-short term memory (convLSTM) layers; finally, the last hidden state passes through a series of fully-connected layers in order to obtain a single classification result. The method is able to detect a variety of violent robberies (i.e., armed robberies involving firearms or knives, or robberies showing different level of aggressiveness) with an accuracy of 96.69\%.},

	abstract = {In satellite image processing, obscure zones that were affected by shadows are normally discarded from further processing. Nevertheless, for specific applications, such as surveillance, it is desirable to remove shadows despite the fact that reconstructed zones do not necessarily have real reflectance values. In that sense, we propose a shadow removal method in high-resolution satellite images using conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs). The generator network is trained to produce shadow-free RGB images with condition on a satellite image patch altered with artificial shadows and concatenated with its respective binary shadow mask, while the discriminator is adversely trained to discern if a given shadow-free image comes from the generator or if it is an original RGB image without artificial alteration. The method is tested in the proposed dataset achieving an error ratio comparable with the state of the art. Finally, we confirm the feasibility of the proposed network using real shadowed images.},

	abstract = {The parameters estimation of a system using indirect measurements over the same system is a problem that occurs in many fields of engineering, known as the inverse problem. It also happens in the field of underwater acoustic, especially in mediums that are not transparent enough. In those cases, shape identification of objects using only acoustic signals is a challenge because it is carried out with information of echoes that are produced by objects with different densities from that of the medium. In general, these echoes are difficult to understand since their information is usually noisy and redundant. In this paper, we propose a model of convolutional neural network with an Encoder-Decoder configuration to estimate both localization and shape of objects, which produce reflected signals. This model allows us to obtain a 2D velocity model. The model was trained with data generated by the finite-difference method, and it achieved a value of 98.58\% in the intersection over union metric 75.88\% in precision and 64.69\% in sensitivity.},

	abstract = {Field-specific fertilizer rate optimization is known to be beneficial for improving farming profit, and profits can be further improved by dividing the field into smaller plots and applying site-specific rates across the field. Finding optimal rates for these plots is often based on data gathered from the plots, which are used to determine a yield response curve, telling us how much fertilizer needs to be applied to maximize yield. In this research, we trained a Random Forest to create plot-specific non-parametric yield response curves. We then use these curves to determine the optimal amount of fertilizer to be applied to specific plots by maximizing a net return function based on these curves. However, we claim that there are additional issues that should be taken into account when designing optimal prescription maps. In addition to optimizing yield, we want to reduce strain on farming equipment by minimizing rate jumps between consecutive cells. This helps machines run more efficiently and last longer, thus reducing waste. Furthermore, when creating these optimized prescription maps, we also aim to improve environmental impact by reducing the overall fertilizer applied, as excess nitrogen seeps into the soil and drains into our waterways, negatively affecting water quality. In previous work, we found that it is possible to reduce overall fertilizer applied by 5 to 10\% when creating experimental prescription maps without significantly impacting yield. Therefore, we hypothesize this will hold true for optimized prescription maps as well. We address these three separate, competing objectives using an adjusted genetic algorithm, known as Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), which finds a set of potential solutions that are optimal for the combined objectives. Such solutions are known as Pareto optimal, where one of the objectives cannot be improved without negatively impacting at least one other objective. We further adjust NSGA-II to use the Factored Evolutionary Algorithm (FEA) framework, which decomposes the variables into separate, overlapping groups to increase exploration of the search space, as well as enabling the ability to parallelize computation.},

	abstract = {Empirically driven adaptive management in large-scale commodity crop production has become possible with spatially controlled application and sub-field scale crop monitoring technology. Site-specific experimentation is fundamental to an agroecosystem adaptive management (AAM) framework that results in information for growers to make informed decisions about their practices with their local data. Crop production and quality response data from combine harvester mounted sensors and internet-available remote sensing allows spatial variability assessment of the experimentally applied input as well as the impact of environment and management covariates that also spatially vary across the field. Repeating the experiments and gathering year-specific economic and weather data allows for incorporating temporal variability into simulation models driven by the locally parameterized crop response models. Field-specific simulation allows comparison of input management alternatives to identify practices that provide the greatest profitability, minimization of pollution from the inputs, and economic resilience. Communication of information to farmers through carefully designed decision support will determine if precision agriculture (PA) provides transparent interactive algorithms that empower farmers to become more knowledgeable agroecologists, or becomes the end point of industrialized agriculture that removes human decisions from agriculture.},

	url = {https://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/16643},
	abstract = {In recent years, Hyperspectral Imaging systems (HSI) have become a powerful source for reliable data in applications such as remote sensing, agriculture, and biomedicine. However, the abundant spectral and spatial information of hyperspectral images makes them highly complex, which leads to the need for specialized Machine Learning algorithms to process and classify them. In that sense, the contribution of this thesis is multi-folded. We present a low-cost convolutional neural network designed for hyperspectral image classification called Hyper3DNet. Its architecture consists of two parts: a series of densely connected 3-D convolutions used as a feature extractor, and a series of 2-D separable convolutions used as a spatial encoder. We show that this design involves fewer trainable parameters compared to other approaches, yet without detriment to its performance. Furthermore, having observed that hyperspectral images benefit from methods to reduce the number of spectral bands while retaining the most useful information for a specific application, we present two novel hyperspectral dimensionality reduction techniques. First, we propose a filter-based method called Inter-Band Redundancy Analysis (IBRA) based on a collinearity analysis between a band and its neighbors. This analysis helps to remove redundant bands and dramatically reduces the search space. Second, we apply a wrapper-based approach called Greedy Spectral Selection (GSS) to the results of IBRA to select bands based on their information entropy values and train a compact Convolutional Neural Network to evaluate the performance of the current selection. We also propose a feature extraction framework that consists of two main steps: first, it reduces the total number of bands using IBRA; then, it can use any feature extraction method to obtain the desired number of feature channels. Finally, we use the original hyperspectral data cube to simulate the process of using actual filters in a multispectral imager. Experimental results show that our proposed Hyper3DNet architecture in conjunction with our dimensionality reduction techniques yields better classification results than the compared methods, producing more suitable results for a multispectral sensor design.},
