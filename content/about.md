Giorgio Morales is a researcher specializing in Symbolic Regression, Explainable and Interpretable 
Machine Learning, and Uncertainty Quantification. His work focuses on developing methods that bridge 
predictive performance and scientific understanding, enabling the discovery of interpretable models 
with robust uncertainty awareness.

He earned his Ph.D. in Computer Science at Montana State University under the supervision of 
Dr. John Sheppard, as a member of the Numerical Intelligent Systems Laboratory (NISL). 
He also holds an M.S. in Computer Science from Montana State University and a B.S. in Mechatronic 
Engineering from the National University of Engineering in Peru.

His research aims to advance transparent machine learning techniques that support scientific discovery, 
decision-making under uncertainty, and data-driven exploration across disciplines such as 
physics, biodiversity, and engineering.
