summary: üé§ I will be speaking at the upcoming Causality and Quantification of Uncertainties Day. 
abstract: 'üìö Understanding and managing uncertainty is a critical aspect of deploying regression neural 
network models in real-world scientific and engineering applications. This presentation introduces two 
novel contributions aimed at improving uncertainty quantification and guiding data acquisition under 
uncertainty. The first is DualAQD, a dual-network architecture for generating high-quality prediction 
intervals (PIs). DualAQD integrates a custom loss function that minimizes interval width while ensuring 
coverage constraints, striking a balance between tightness and reliability of uncertainty estimates. 
It consistently outperforms existing PI-generation techniques in both interval efficiency and prediction 
accuracy across diverse datasets. 
Building on DualAQD uncertainty modeling, we present ASPINN, an adaptive sampling strategy designed for 
data-scarce environments where measurement collection is costly or constrained. ASPINN addresses this 
by focusing on epistemic uncertainty reduction in regression problems, using NN-generated PIs to guide 
adaptive data acquisition to strategically select new data points that most reduce model uncertainty. 
By incorporating a Gaussian Process surrogate to support batch sampling, ASPINN balances informativeness 
and diversity in acquisition decisions. Empirical evaluations show that ASPINN achieves faster convergence 
and greater uncertainty reduction compared to leading alternatives. Together, these methods offer a robust 
framework for uncertainty-aware learning in regression tasks.'
