abstract: Response curves exhibit the magnitude of the response of a sensitive system
  to a varying stimulus. However, response of such systems may be sensitive to multiple
  stimuli (i.e., input features) that are not necessarily independent. As a consequence,
  the shape of response curves generated for a selected input feature (referred to
  as “active feature”) might depend on the values of the other input features (referred
  to as “passive features”). In this work we consider the case of systems whose response
  is approximated using regression neural networks. We propose to use counterfactual
  explanations (CFEs) for the identification of the features with the highest relevance
  on the shape of response curves generated by neural network black boxes. CFEs are
  generated by a genetic algorithm-based approach that solves a multi-objective optimization
  problem. In particular, given a response curve generated for an active feature,
  a CFE finds the minimum combination of passive features that need to be modified
  to alter the shape of the response curve. We tested our method on a synthetic dataset
  with 1-D inputs and two crop yield prediction datasets with 2-D inputs. The relevance
  ranking of features and feature combinations obtained on the synthetic dataset coincided
  with the analysis of the equation that was used to generate the problem. Results
  obtained on the yield prediction datasets revealed that the impact on fertilizer
  responsivity of passive features depends on the terrain characteristics of each
  field.
