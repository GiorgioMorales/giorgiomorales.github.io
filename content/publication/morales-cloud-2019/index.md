abstract: The cloud detection process is a prerequisite for many remote sensing applications
  in order to use only those cloud-free parts of satellite images and reduce errors
  of further automatic detection algorithms. In this paper, we present a method to
  detect clouds in high-resolution images of 2.8 m per pixel approximately. The process
  is performed over those pixels that exceed a defined threshold of blue normalized
  difference vegetation index to reduce the execution time. From each pixel, a set
  of texture descriptors and reflectance descriptors are processed in an Artificial
  Neural Network. The texture descriptors are extracted using the Gray-Level Co-occurrence
  Matrix. Each detection result passes through a false-positive discard procedure
  on the blue component of the panchromatic fusion based on image processing techniques
  such as Region growing, Hough transform, among others. The results show a minimum
  Kappa coefficient of 0.80 and an average of 0.94 over a set of 25 images from the
  Peruvian satellite PERUSAT-1, operational since December 2016.
