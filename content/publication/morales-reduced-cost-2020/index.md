abstract: 'Hyperspectral imaging provides a useful tool for extracting complex information
  when visual spectral bands are not enough to solve certain tasks. However, processing
  hyperspectral images (HSIs) is usually computationally expensive due to the great
  amount of both spatial and spectral data they incorporate. We present a low-cost
  convolutional neural network designed for HSI classification. Its architecture consists
  of two parts: a series of densely connected three-dimensional (3-D) convolutions
  used as a feature extractor, and a series of two-dimensional (2-D) separable convolutions
  used as a spatial encoder. We show that this design involves fewer trainable parameters
  compared to other approaches, yet without detriment to its performance. What is
  more, we achieve comparable state-of-the-art results testing our architecture on
  four public remote sensing datasets: Indian Pines, Pavia University, Salinas, and
  EuroSAT; and a dataset of Kochia leaves [Bassia scoparia] with three different levels
  of herbicide resistance. The source code and datasets are available online. (Hyper3DNet
