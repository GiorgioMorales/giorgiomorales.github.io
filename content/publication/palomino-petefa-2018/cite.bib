 abstract = {Providing timely information through remote sensing tools to the farmers and to the National Institute of Agrarian Innovation (INIA) is important to manage the production of yellow corn crops (Zea Mays) in the region of Lambayeque, Peru. This paper addresses three objectives by providing information in different levels: First, provide information about the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from crops in their different stages during their lifecycle; secondly, provide georeferenced soil analysis information organized by parcels and, finally, provide information about evapotranspiration of each parcel calculated using weather station sensors, soil type, land uses and georefer-enced NDVI masks. All this information is provided through a Geographic Information System called Remote Sensing Platform for Agricultural Purposes (PETEFA), which is based on open source tools. In short, PETEFA is a monitoring tool that provides information through a computer or mobile device to the farmers or the INIA.},
