abstract: 'Providing timely information through remote sensing tools to the farmers
  and to the National Institute of Agrarian Innovation (INIA) is important to manage
  the production of yellow corn crops (Zea Mays) in the region of Lambayeque, Peru.
  This paper addresses three objectives by providing information in different levels:
  First, provide information about the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)
  from crops in their different stages during their lifecycle; secondly, provide georeferenced
  soil analysis information organized by parcels and, finally, provide information
  about evapotranspiration of each parcel calculated using weather station sensors,
  soil type, land uses and georefer-enced NDVI masks. All this information is provided
  through a Geographic Information System called Remote Sensing Platform for Agricultural
  Purposes (PETEFA), which is based on open source tools. In short, PETEFA is a monitoring
  tool that provides information through a computer or mobile device to the farmers
  or the INIA.'
