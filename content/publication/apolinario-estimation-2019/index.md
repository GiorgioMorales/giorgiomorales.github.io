abstract: The parameters estimation of a system using indirect measurements over the
  same system is a problem that occurs in many fields of engineering, known as the
  inverse problem. It also happens in the field of underwater acoustic, especially
  in mediums that are not transparent enough. In those cases, shape identification
  of objects using only acoustic signals is a challenge because it is carried out
  with information of echoes that are produced by objects with different densities
  from that of the medium. In general, these echoes are difficult to understand since
  their information is usually noisy and redundant. In this paper, we propose a model
  of convolutional neural network with an Encoder-Decoder configuration to estimate
  both localization and shape of objects, which produce reflected signals. This model
  allows us to obtain a 2D velocity model. The model was trained with data generated
  by the finite-difference method, and it achieved a value of 98.58% in the intersection
  over union metric 75.88% in precision and 64.69% in sensitivity.
