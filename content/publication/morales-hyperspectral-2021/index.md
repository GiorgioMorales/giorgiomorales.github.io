abstract: 'In recent years, Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) has become a powerful source
  for reliable data in applications such as remote sensing, agriculture, and biomedicine.
  However, hyperspectral images are highly data-dense and often benefit from methods
  to reduce the number of spectral bands while retaining the most useful information
  for a specific application. We propose a novel band selection method to select a
  reduced set of wavelengths, obtained from an HSI system in the context of image
  classification. Our approach consists of two main steps: the first utilizes a filter-based
  approach to find relevant spectral bands based on a collinearity analysis between
  a band and its neighbors. This analysis helps to remove redundant bands and dramatically
  reduces the search space. The second step applies a wrapper-based approach to select
  bands from the reduced set based on their information entropy values, and trains
  a compact Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to evaluate the performance of the
  current selection. We present classification results obtained from our method and
  compare them to other feature selection methods on two hyperspectral image datasets.
  Additionally, we use the original hyperspectral data cube to simulate the process
  of using actual filters in a multispectral imager. We show that our method produces
  more suitable results for a multispectral sensor design.'
