abstract: 'Video surveillance through security cameras has become difficult due to
  the fact that many systems require manual human inspection for identifying violent
  or suspicious scenarios, which is practically inefficient. Therefore, the contribution
  of this paper is twofold: the presentation of a video dataset called UNI-Crime,
  and the proposal of a violent robbery detection method in CCTV videos using a deep-learning
  sequence model. Each of the 30 frames of our videos passes through a pre-trained
  VGG-16 feature extractor; then, all the sequence of features is processed by two
  convolutional long-short term memory (convLSTM) layers; finally, the last hidden
  state passes through a series of fully-connected layers in order to obtain a single
  classification result. The method is able to detect a variety of violent robberies
  (i.e., armed robberies involving firearms or knives, or robberies showing different
  level of aggressiveness) with an accuracy of 96.69%.'
