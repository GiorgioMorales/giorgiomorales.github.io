abstract: Nowadays, it is frequent to monitor large crop areas using high-precision
  active sensors for measuring NDVI or multispectral cameras mounted on UAVs. However,
  the NDVI calculations using multispectral images differ from the readings of an
  active sensor for the same object or surface. What is more, there is a difference
  between the NDVI values of two multispectral images taken with different lighting
  conditions or height over the same object. In this paper, we propose new models
  to estimate NDVI using aerial images from a multispectral camera with values comparable
  to those of a portable active sensor. For this, we propose a methodology where three
  lambertian reflection surfaces are chosen and characterized with a hyperspectral
  camera. These surfaces appear in the aerial images and are used as control points
  of three NDVI values in the range of 0 to 1. Then, a linear model and an exponential
  model, derived from the original NDVI calculation expression, are proposed and evaluated,
  using the spectral information of the pixels inside a region equivalent to the active
  sensor reflection zone and the NDVI measurements of the same sensor. After the conditioning
  of the data, the parameters of the models are obtained by calculating the minimum
  squared errors. In addition, we have done a set of tests to verify the variations
  of the parameters versus the positioning uncertainty, different lighting conditions
  and different heights in the range of 15 to 40 m. The results show that the parameters
  of the two proposed models vary with the height, maintaining the absolute differences
  of NDVI close to 0.01, which is equivalent to the resolution of the active sensor;
  the smallest differences occur for the linear model in the interpolation interval,
  while the exponential model has a high accuracy near the upper limit of NDVI.
