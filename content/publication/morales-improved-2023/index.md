abstract: 'In recent years, the use of remotely sensed and on-ground observations
  of crop fields, in conjunction with machine learning techniques, has led to highly
  accurate crop yield estimations. In this work, we propose to further improve the
  yield prediction task by using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) given their
  unique ability to exploit the spatial information of small regions of the field.
  We present a novel CNN architecture called Hyper3DNetReg that takes in a multi-channel
  input raster and, unlike previous approaches, outputs a two-dimensional raster,
  where each output pixel represents the predicted yield value of the corresponding
  input pixel. Our proposed method then generates a yield prediction map by aggregating
  the overlapping yield prediction patches obtained throughout the field. Our data
  consist of a set of eight rasterized remotely-sensed features: nitrogen rate applied,
  precipitation, slope, elevation, topographic position index (TPI), aspect, and two
  radar backscatter coefficients acquired from the Sentinel-1 satellites. We use data
  collected during the early stage of the winter wheat growing season (March) to predict
  yield values during the harvest season (August). We present leave-one-out cross-validation
  experiments for rain-fed winter wheat over four fields and show that our proposed
  methodology produces better predictions than five compared methods, including Bayesian
  multiple linear regression, standard multiple linear regression, random forest,
  an ensemble of feedforward networks using AdaBoost, a stacked autoencoder, and two
  other CNN architectures.'
