abstract: Empirically driven adaptive management in large-scale commodity crop production
  has become possible with spatially controlled application and sub-field scale crop
  monitoring technology. Site-specific experimentation is fundamental to an agroecosystem
  adaptive management (AAM) framework that results in information for growers to make
  informed decisions about their practices with their local data. Crop production
  and quality response data from combine harvester mounted sensors and internet-available
  remote sensing allows spatial variability assessment of the experimentally applied
  input as well as the impact of environment and management covariates that also spatially
  vary across the field. Repeating the experiments and gathering year-specific economic
  and weather data allows for incorporating temporal variability into simulation models
  driven by the locally parameterized crop response models. Field-specific simulation
  allows comparison of input management alternatives to identify practices that provide
  the greatest profitability, minimization of pollution from the inputs, and economic
  resilience. Communication of information to farmers through carefully designed decision
  support will determine if precision agriculture (PA) provides transparent interactive
  algorithms that empower farmers to become more knowledgeable agroecologists, or
  becomes the end point of industrialized agriculture that removes human decisions
  from agriculture.
