abstract: Detecting shadows in high-resolution satellite images is a challenging task
  due to the fact that shadows can easily be mistaken for low reflectance soil or
  water and that such images have limited spectral bands. In this work, we propose
  a semantic level shadow segmentation by using generative adversarial networks and
  created a dataset of pre-processed images for training, validation and test. In
  this way, we trained a generator network that produces shadow masks with condition
  on a satellite image patch and tries to fool a discriminator, which is trained to
  discern if a given mask comes from the ground truth or from the generator model.
  The results achieve an accuracy of 95.85% and a Kappa coefficient of 91.76%, which
  is superior to the compared methods.
