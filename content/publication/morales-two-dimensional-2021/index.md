abstract: 'Crop yield prediction is one of the tasks of Precision Agriculture that
  can be automated based on multi-source periodic observations of the fields. We tackle
  the yield prediction problem using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained
  on data that combines radar satellite imagery and on-ground information. We present
  a CNN architecture called Hyper3DNetReg that takes in a multi-channel input image
  and outputs a two-dimensional raster, where each pixel represents the predicted
  yield value of the corresponding input pixel. We utilize radar data acquired from
  the Sentinel-1 satellites, while the on-ground data correspond to a set of six raster
  features: nitrogen rate applied, precipitation, slope, elevation, topographic position
  index (TPI), and aspect. We use data collected during the early stage of the winter
  wheat growing season (March) to predict yield values during the harvest season (August).
  We present experiments over four fields of winter wheat and show that our proposed
  methodology yields better results than five compared methods, including multiple
  linear regression, an ensemble of feedforward networks using AdaBoost, a stacked
  autoencoder, and two other CNN architectures.'
