The goal of the Analytic Engine of the On-Farm Precision Experiment Framework (OFPE) project is to 
propose new computational methods based on the latest artificial intelligence and machine learning 
techniques to process the collected information from the fields efficiently and automatically to 
predict future values of variables of interest for the farmers, such as yield or protein content. 
This knowledge will be useful to propose a more efficient use of the available resources 
(e.g., water, nutrients, and pesticides), avoiding waste, minimizing environmental impact, and 
maximizing profit.
