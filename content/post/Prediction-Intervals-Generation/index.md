üîç Are you looking to generate prediction intervals using neural networks? Our recent journal paper, 
["Dual Accuracy-Quality-Driven Neural Network for Prediction Interval Generation,"](/publication/morales-dual-2023) published in IEEE TNNLS, provides a comprehensive guide.

üíª Want to try it out yourself? Dive into our interactive Google Colab notebook to see our approach in action:  
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/NISL-MSU/PredictionIntervals/blob/master/DualAQD_PredictionIntervals.ipynb)
 
üöÄ Ready to get started? Install the "PredictionIntervals" package using pip. Check our [Github repo](https://github.com/NISL-MSU/PredictionIntervals).
