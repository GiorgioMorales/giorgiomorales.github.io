I will be presenting my dissertation proposal, titled "Decomposable Symbolic Regression Using 
Transformers and Neural Network-Assisted Genetic Algorithms," at the [European Conference on Machine Learning and 
Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases 2024 PhD Forum](https://ecmlpkdd.org/2024/submissions-phd-forum/).

The purpose of the forum is to provide an environment for PhD students, at any stage of their doctoral 
studies, to present their work and get constructive feedback from senior researchers in machine learning, 
knowledge discovery, and related areas.
I will discuss my latest paper ["Univariate skeleton prediction in multivariate systems
using transformers"](/publication/morales-univariate-2024), accepted for the Research Track of ECML PKDD 2024.
In addition, I will share details about future plans and technical details of my dissertation proposal.
