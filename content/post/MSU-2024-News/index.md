> "(...) Morales is developing AI methods to determine how combinations and quantities of variables such as soil nutrients, nitrates, humidity and precipitation influence a particular outcome – in this case, crop yield. It’s part of a practice in farming called precision agriculture, in which novel technologies are integrated into production systems."

> "(...) But, for Morales, his dissertation is only indirectly about maximizing crop yields and minimizing wasted seed and fertilizer. His primary objective is to develop computer models of data-crunching techniques that utilize a powerful subset of AI called neural symbolic regression. It may sound like a biological function within the human brain, but it’s actually a highly complex computer process that transforms the data into a mathematical function that, thanks to AI, is highly adaptable to different settings or projects."
