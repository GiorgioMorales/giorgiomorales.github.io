### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a PhD student in computer science at Montana State University and a current member of the Numerical Intelligent Systems Laboratory (NISL). I hold a BS in mechatronic engineering from the National University of Engineering, Peru, and an MS in computer science from Montana State University, USA. My research interests are Deep Learning, Explainable Machine Learning, Automated Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Precision Agriculture.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the [On-Field Precision Experiment](https://sites.google.com/site/ofpeframework/home) project.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Symbolic Regression and Bayesian Optimization.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/him/his.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Birds are real.
